# RaffleBot üéâ
RaffleBot is a discord bot built originally for [The Programmer's Hangout](https://github.com/the-programmers-hangout) that focuses on managing giveaways.
This bot might be useful for all kinds of discord servers though.

- [x] Multi Guild support
    - [x] A conversation simplifies the initial guild configuration
    - [x] Each guild can configure its own bot prefix

    - [x] Each guild can configure RaffleBots permission system to work with different `Staff` and `Admin` roles
- [x] Dockerize the bot easily via the provided **Dockerfile** and **docker-compose.yml** file

## Commands
Refer to [commands.md](commands.md) for a general list and explanation of all available commands. To learn about commands during runtime, use the `help` command!

## Getting Started ‚öôÔ∏è
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Requirements
- Java
- Docker
- Docker-Compose (compatible with docker-compose version 3.8)

Get the Docker version you need [here](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=docker&type=edition&offering=community)!

### Setup
Since this bot has a **docker-compose.yml** file and is hosted on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/theprogrammershangout/rafflebot), all you need to start your own version of RaffleBot locally is to `clone` this repository and set up the **.env** file.

The **.env** file is used to configure the bot token and owner id, in the following format: 

```
BOT_TOKEN=<insert-bot-token>
BOT_OWNER=<insert-owner-id>
```

#### For **Linux** and **Mac** run
```console
$ cp .env.example .env
```

#### For **Windows** run
```powershell
> Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Edit the **.env** file with your favourite editor, filling out the following properties:
- **BOT_TOKEN** (you can find the bot token under `https://discord.com/developers/applications/bot-id/bot` for an overview of all your bots visit https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- **BOT_OWNER** ([Where can I find my User/Server/Message ID?](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-))

Run the bot via `docker-compose`
```console
$ docker-compose up --build --detach
```

## Setup development environment üõ†Ô∏è
For development you don't necessarily need **Docker** and **Docker-Compose** but **Java**
- `clone` this repository
- Open the project in your favourite Java / Kotlin IDE (JetBrains [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is the recommended IDE for Kotlin projects)
- For running the bot within your IDE you need to add your bot token as `program argument` or `environment variable` (You might have to figure out how to do that in your IDE. **IntelliJ** let's you do that under `Run -> Edit Configurations...`)
